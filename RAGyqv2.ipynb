            "degree of comprehensiveness in that they may:\n",
            "(A) Contain authorities that provide the basis for certain post-inspection\n",

            "mechanisms;\n",
            "(B) Include specific requirements that are different from those provided in this\n",

            "embodied in sections of the law that transcend and are separate from those\n",
            "governing food establishments.\n",
            "Consequently, in this document a deliberate attempt is made to extract those provisions\n",
            "that could conceptually be adopted as an extension of Chapter 8 if they were\n",
            "compatible with existing, governing State and local statutes. The extracted provisions\n",
            "are numbered to sequentially follow Chapter 8 but are placed in this Annex so that\n",
